# Banshee Engine

Banshee is a 3D render engine written in C++23. It aims to be a modern, high-performance and easy-to-use.
It is currently in development and not ready for production use.
The project is open to contributions and suggestions.
The name is temporary and will be changed in the future. (perhaps)

## Build

### Prerequisites

- OpenGL 4.6 compatible GPU
- Git
- CMake 3.28 or higher
- C++23 compiler (Clang 18 or higher, MSVC 19.30 or higher)

### Build steps

1) Clone the repository
2) Use CMake to build the project
3) Enjoy

Remember to set your working directory to the root of the project when running the executable.

## Important notes

- Banshee is primarily developed on Windows, so it may not work on other platforms. 
- Also, it is compiled primarily with clang-cl via MSYS2 so MSVC may not work in every commit.
- The API is extremely unstable and may change at any time, it's better for me to iterate quickly.
- The modules names can be changed in the future.
